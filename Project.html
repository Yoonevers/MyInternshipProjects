                <p style="text-align: center">Famous for his hefty History of Soviet Russia, E. H. Carr’s foray into historiography (that is, the study of written history)<br>
                 was panned by critics at first. Initially written off as ‘dangerous relativism’, it is now considered a foundational text for historians,<br>
                 one which probes at the very seams of the discipline. By asking what exactly historical knowledge is and what constitutes history<br>
                 as we have come to understand it, Carr provides a compelling and masterful critique of the biases of historians and their moralized narratives of history.<br>

                Though first and foremost considered a political theorist, much of Marxist thought can be a means to understand history with attention to<br>
                economic systems and principles. In this seminal text, Marx argues that all of history has been defined by the struggles between<br>
                the proletariat working-class and the capital-owning bourgeoisie. According to Marx, economic structures have been defined by class relations,<br>
                and the various revolutions that have occurred throughout history have been instigated by antagonism between these two forces.

                A titan of Middle Eastern political and historical study, Edward Said coined the titular phrase <em>Orientalism</em> to describe the West's<br>
                often reductive and derisive depiction and portrayal of "The East." This book is an explanation of this concept and the application of<br>
                this framework to understand the global power dynamics between the East and the West. Orientalism is considered by many a challenging read,<br>
                but donot let its formidable reputation put you off — it’ll all be worth it when you find yourself thinking about global history in ways you haven’t before.

                It is no big secret that the US school curriculum is more than a little biased — governments have a tendency to rewrite history textbooks in their favour,<br>
                and the US government is no exception, keeping quiet on the grizzly, harrowing details and episodes which made the USA the country it is today.<br>
                With particular focus on the American Civil War, Native Americans and the Atlantic Slave Trade, Loewen tries to interrogate and override simplistic,<br>
                recountings of these events that portray White settlers as heroes and everybody else as uncivilized and barbarous.

                discussed and debated. With this book, Cartledge presents a biography of a political system that has been alternately lauded as the only means<br>
                to govern a liberal society and derided as doomed to ineffectiveness.Based on a near-legendary course of lectures Cartledge taught at Cambridge University,<br>
                this book charts the social, cultural, and political dimensions of democracy, displaying a mastery of the scholarship to brilliant effect.
